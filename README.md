# 00 – Foundations

This repository is part of my self-retraining journey to relearn
programming fundamentals from the ground up without relying on AI
to write code for me.

## Goals
- Rebuild problem-solving skills
- Understand how code works under the hood
- Write clean, readable, and debuggable programs

## Rules
- I write all code myself
- AI is used only for explanations and reviews
- Every project is committed, even if imperfect

## Progress
- [ ] Week 1 – C basics & CLI programs
- [ ] Week 2 – Memory, pointers, debugging
